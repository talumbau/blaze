**Blaze** is the next-generation of NumPy. It is designed as a
foundational set of abstractions on which to build out-of-core and
distributed algorithms over a wide variety of data sources and to extend
the structure of NumPy itself.

Blaze allows easy composition of low level computation kernels
( C, Fortran, Numba ) to form complex data transformations on large
datasets.

In Blaze, computations are described in a high-level language
(Python) but executed on a low-level runtime (outside of Python),
enabling the easy mapping of high-level expertise to data without sacrificing
low-level performance. Blaze aims to bring Python and NumPy into the
massively-multicore arena, allowing it to able to leverage many CPU and
GPU cores across computers, virtual machines and cloud services.

Continuum Analytics' vision is to provide open technologies for data
integration on a massive scale based on a vision of a structured,
universal "data web". In the same way that URL, HTML, and HTTP form
the basis of the World Wide Web for documents, Blaze could
be a fabric for structured and numerical data spearheading
innovations in data management, analytics, and distributed computation.

Blaze aims to be a foundational project allowing many different users of
other PyData projects (Pandas, Theano, Numba, SciPy, Scikit-Learn)
to interoperate at the application level and at the library level with
the goal of being able to to lift their existing functionality into a
distributed context.

Status
------

Blaze is a work in progress at the moment, currently at release 0.5.
Take a look at the [release notes](docs/source/releases.rst).

Documentation
-------------

* [Dev Docs](http://blaze.pydata.org/docs/)

Trying out Blaze
----------------

The easiest way to try out Blaze is through the Anaconda
distribution. The latest release includes a version of Blaze.

http://continuum.io/downloads

To make sure you're running the latest released version
of Blaze, use the
[conda package manager](http://docs.continuum.io/conda/index.html)
to update.

```bash
$ conda update blaze
```

Source code for the latest development version of blaze can
be obtained [from Github](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/blaze).

Dependencies
------------

The Blaze project itself is spread out over multiple projects,
in addition to the main `blaze` repo. These dependencies
are

  * [blz][blz]
  * [datashape][datashape]
  * [dynd-python][dynd-python]
  * [pykit][pykit]

To see a full list of dependencies, please see `requirements.txt`

[blz]: https://github.com/ContinuumIO/blz
[datashape]: https://github.com/ContinuumIO/datashape
[dynd-python]: https://github.com/ContinuumIO/dynd-python
[pykit]: https://github.com/pykit/pykit

Installing from Source
----------------------

Install all the pre-requisites using conda or another mechanism,
then run:

```bash
$ python setup.py install
```

Documentation is generated using sphinx from the docs directory.

Installing from Binstar.org
----------------------

Binstar is a service that allows you to create and manage public and private package registries. 
If you're on a Linux or Mac OS X platform, you can install a binary version of blaze (hosted on binstar) by typing:

```bash
$ conda install -c mwiebe -c mrocklin blaze
```
